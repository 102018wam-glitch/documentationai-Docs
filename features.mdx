## Document Organization and Hierarchy Setup

Organize your documentation into a clear hierarchy using folders and pages. You start by creating a root workspace, then nest pages under folders for logical grouping, such as `/api/reference` or `/guides/quickstart`.

    A[Workspace] --> B[API]
    A --> C[Guides]
    B --> D[Endpoints]
    B --> E[Authentication]
    C --> F[Quickstart]
    C --> G[Advanced]
```
